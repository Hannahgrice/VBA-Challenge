For the Module 2 challenge i was able to work with tutor Reshaan Gareeb while he walked me through a literal analysis of the module 2 challenge, but did not go over code with me.
For help on gathering my code I did trial and error as well as pulled examples of sequences frm my notes and looked up basic tutorials of how to make certain calculations on youtube besides using MOD.
